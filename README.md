## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally.

### 1. Database Setup

1. Start your MySQL server.
2. Create a new database named `store_rating_db`.
3. Execute the SQL commands found in the `database.sql` file (or from the initial project setup) to create the `users`, `stores`, and `ratings` tables.

### 2. Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
```
cd backend
```
2. Install the required npm packages:
```
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` root directory and add the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your database credentials:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=store_rating_db
JWT_SECRET=a_long_and_very_secret_key_for_your_jwt
PORT=5000
```
4. Start the backend server:
```
npm start
```
The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory:
```
cd frontend
```
2. Install the required npm packages:
```
npm install
```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` root directory and add the following:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
4. Start the frontend development server:
```
npm run dev
```
The application should now be accessible at `build store rating app website from the above information given in step by step manner with code in backend frontend and database in vs code` (or another port specified by Vite).
